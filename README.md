A basic calculator that performs four functions- +, -, * and /. That is, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
It takes 2 integer inputs in the text areas and returns the result as per the button selected.

MOTIVATION: I wanted to practice the very basic principles of Core JAVA.

BUILD STATUS: This a mini project and is completely built.

CODE STYLE: As mentioned I have used JAVA with assistance from IntelliJ Idea.
